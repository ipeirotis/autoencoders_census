Step 1: data_loader, loads the dataset and returns back a processed dataframe that can then be encoded/decoded

Step 2: autoencoder, sets up the architecture of the autoencoder

Step 3: hyperparameter_tuning, finds the optimal parameters for the neural network for the autoencoder

Step 4: measure_accuracy, measures how we well we can reconstruct each attribute of the dataset

Step 5: fine_outliers, examines which rows of the dataset are the most difficult to reconstruct (and therefore are likely to come from inattentive/mischevious participants)
